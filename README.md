# TUMaccept
This program checks grades and provides a score based on the guidelines for the courses of Mechanical Engineering (Maschinenwesen)
and Engineering Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). 

The points provided by this tool are a conservative estimate of the TUM's actual criteria. TUM says that they will round up at some intermediate points, which this tool does not do. Rounding only takes place at the final step in this tool, and it will be rounded up, like the TUM does.

I DO NOT TAKE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY RESULTS THIS TOOL GIVES YOU, AND FOR ANY DECISIONS YOU MAKE A RESULT. I will make all efforts to keep this accurate, but make no guarantees that it is so. By using this tool, you agree with the above.

Feel free to add an issue here if you have a question, see a bug or have a feature idea, or to add a pull request if you find something to change.

The live version is hosted on Github Pages via the docs directory. Do not change anything there in a pull request.

You can access the hosted version at [tumaccept.tk](https://tumaccept.tk)
